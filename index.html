        <h1>German Shepherd</h1>
        <p>
          About the Breed Generally considered dogkind's finest all-purpose
          worker, the German Shepherd Dog is a large, agile, muscular dog of
          noble character and high intelligence. Loyal, confident, courageous,
          and steady, the German Shepherd is truly a dog lover's delight. German
          Shepherd Dogs can stand as high as 26 inches at the shoulder and, when
          viewed in outline, presents a picture of smooth, graceful curves
          rather than angles. The natural gait is a free-and-easy trot, but they
          can turn it up a notch or two and reach great speeds. There are many
          reasons why German Shepherds stand in the front rank of canine
          royalty, but experts say their defining attribute is character:
          loyalty, courage, confidence, the ability to learn commands for many
          tasks, and the willingness to put their life on the line in defense of
          loved ones. German Shepherds will be gentle family pets and steadfast
          guardians, but, the breed standard says, there's a 'certain aloofness
          that does not lend itself to immediate and indiscriminate
          friendships.National Breed Club & Rescue Want to connect with other
